          Research and Development of technologies for conducting occupancy surveys and analysis,, using computer vision and graph databases.
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          **About:** As industrial PhD researcher, I developed a framework for collecting and analysing data on how the built environment is used.
          The projects focus was to get as much information about how architecture is used, back to the architects who plan and design it.


          - Mapping of existing technologies and methods, in relation to company interests.
          - Development of prototype, capable of detecting objects and and their semantic relationships
          - Development of graph database in Neo4j for storage and analysis of query results.
          - Internal consultancy, on data driven design and use of sensors.

          **Tools and Technologies:** Nvidia Jetson, Kinect Azure, Xovis, Ubiqisense, Neo4j + Dash & Bloom, Rhino3D, Grasshopper, PyTorch Python, Pandas, Docker, VS devcontainer, Pedsim Pro

          Computation in Architecture is an international masters that explores the critical consideration of technology as a driver for thinking, forming and realising architecture. With specific focus on digital design, bio-materials and design, advanced modelling, smart sensing and robotic fabrication, the program fosters a dynamic, creative, intellectually rigorous and design-led environment that stimulates critical inquiry into issues of sustainability, site, structure, behavior, materiality and architectural expression.

#          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.
